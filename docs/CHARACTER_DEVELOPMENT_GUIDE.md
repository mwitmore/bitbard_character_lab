# Character Development Guide

## Overview

This guide walks you through creating sophisticated AI characters in the Eliza Character Laboratory. Learn how to develop authentic personalities, speech patterns, and behavioral systems.

## Phase 1: Character Research & Analysis

### Historical/Fictional Characters
1. **Source Material Analysis**
   - Gather primary texts (letters, speeches, writings)
   - Analyze secondary sources and biographies
   - Identify key personality traits and motivations
   - Document speech patterns and vocabulary

2. **Linguistic Pattern Extraction**
   - Sentence structure preferences
   - Vocabulary choices and frequency
   - Formal vs informal speech contexts
   - Cultural and temporal speech markers

3. **Behavioral Pattern Identification**
   - Core beliefs and values
   - Reaction patterns to different situations
   - Decision-making processes
   - Social interaction preferences

### Original Characters
1. **Personality Foundation**
   - Define core personality traits
   - Establish background and history
   - Determine motivations and goals
   - Create consistent value system

2. **Voice Development**
   - Choose formality level
   - Develop vocabulary preferences
   - Create unique expressions or phrases
   - Establish communication style

## Phase 2: Character Configuration

### Basic Setup
```json
{
  "name": "CharacterName",
  "modelProvider": "deepseek",
  "system": "Core character definition and behavioral guidelines",
  "bio": ["Character background and key information"],
  "lore": ["Detailed world knowledge and context"]
}
```

### Advanced Behavioral Rules
```json
{
  "style": {
    "all": [
      "Never break character",
      "Maintain consistent personality",
      "Use appropriate vocabulary for the character"
    ],
    "chat": [
      "Engage naturally in conversation",
      "Show curiosity appropriate to character"
    ],
    "post": [
      "Share thoughts relevant to character interests",
      "Maintain character voice in all posts"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Anti-Pattern Protocols
```json
{
  "style": {
    "all": [
      "NEVER echo user words as questions",
      "ALWAYS make declarative statements",
      "AVOID repetitive response patterns",
      "PREVENT formulaic openings or closings"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Phase 3: Message Examples Development

### Quality Guidelines
- **Authenticity**: Responses should feel genuinely from the character
- **Variety**: Avoid repetitive patterns in similar situations
- **Context**: Show how character reacts to different conversation types
- **Consistency**: Maintain character voice across all examples

### Example Categories
1. **Greeting/Introduction**
2. **Topic Discussion** (character's areas of interest)
3. **Personal Questions** (about character's life/background)
4. **Modern Concepts** (how character interprets current topics)
5. **Emotional Situations** (showing character's emotional range)

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation

### Automated Testing
Use the validation suite to test character responses:
```bash
cd tests/cue-validation
node run_character_validation.js characters/your-character.json
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Character never breaks voice
- [ ] Responses feel authentic to character
- [ ] No repetitive patterns in similar contexts
- [ ] Appropriate emotional range displayed
- [ ] Consistent personality across different topics

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Problem**: Character sounds too modern
**Solution**: Review vocabulary choices and sentence structures, add period-appropriate expressions

**Problem**: Repetitive response patterns
**Solution**: Add more varied message examples, implement response rotation

**Problem**: Character breaks personality under pressure
**Solution**: Strengthen system prompt and add specific behavioral guidelines

## Phase 5: Advanced Features

### Memory Integration
```json
{
  "plugins": ["@elizaos-plugins/adapter-sqlite"],
  "settings": {
    "memorySettings": {
      "maxConversationLength": 100,
      "memoryDecayFactor": 0.95
    }
  }
}
```

### Temporal Behavior
```json
{
  "postingConstraints": {
    "maxPostsPerDay": 10,
    "postingCooldownMinutes": 30,
    "activeHours": {
      "start": 18,
      "end": 6,
      "timezone": "UTC"
    }
  }
}
```

### Platform-Specific Optimization
```json
{
  "clients": ["twitter"],
  "twitterSettings": {
    "maxTweetLength": 280,
    "includeImages": false,
    "replyToMentions": true
  }
}
```

## Phase 6: Deployment & Monitoring

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Character voice consistent
- [ ] Credentials configured
- [ ] Monitoring system ready

### Launch Process
1. Start with limited interactions
2. Monitor first 24 hours closely
3. Adjust based on real-world performance
4. Gradually increase interaction frequency

### Performance Metrics
- **Authenticity Score**: How well character maintains voice
- **Engagement Rate**: User interaction quality
- **Consistency Index**: Behavioral stability over time
- **Response Variety**: Avoiding repetitive patterns

## Best Practices

### Do's
✅ Study source material thoroughly
✅ Test extensively before deployment
✅ Monitor real-world performance
✅ Iterate based on user feedback
✅ Maintain character integrity

### Don'ts
❌ Rush the development process
❌ Ignore user feedback
❌ Let character break voice
❌ Use repetitive response patterns
❌ Overcomplicate initial versions

## Character Types & Considerations

### Historical Figures
- Research accuracy is crucial
- Respect for historical context
- Balance authenticity with engagement
- Handle controversial topics sensitively

### Fictional Characters
- Stay true to source material
- Consider fan expectations
- Expand personality within established bounds
- Create new content that feels authentic

### Original Characters
- Establish clear personality foundation
- Maintain internal consistency
- Develop unique voice and mannerisms
- Create interesting backstory and motivations

## Troubleshooting

### Character Breaks Voice
1. Review system prompt strength
2. Add more specific behavioral guidelines
3. Increase message example variety
4. Test edge cases more thoroughly

### Repetitive Responses
1. Implement response rotation system
2. Add more varied message examples
3. Use dynamic context awareness
4. Review template patterns

### Poor User Engagement
1. Analyze user interaction patterns
2. Adjust character personality approachability
3. Improve conversation flow
4. Add more engaging topics

## Next Steps

After successful character deployment:
1. **Continuous Monitoring**: Track performance metrics
2. **Regular Updates**: Refine based on real-world data
3. **Feature Expansion**: Add new capabilities gradually
4. **Community Building**: Foster user engagement
5. **Character Evolution**: Allow natural development over time
